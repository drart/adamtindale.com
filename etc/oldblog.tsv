9	Is Live Playing?	March 30, 2010	post	Max 4 Live,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/m4l/9/	So, more explorations with Max 4 Live are underway. It is interesting under there. I ran into a problem where I automated some parameters and then skipped to another place in my Live set. When I pressed play the parameters of my max patch were a little whacky and I need to bang them to get fresh updated statuses. Loadbang doesn't work since it wasn't an instantiation of a device.I found the solution. The live_set has a parameter that is observable and will tell you if Live is playing. Guess what it is called? That's right - is_playing. So I have a screenshot of this snippet of a Max 4 Live patch that you can check out an use to send a bang when Live is set to play.Enjoy!<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/isliveplaying.tiff"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10" title="isliveplaying" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/isliveplaying.tiff" alt="" /></a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1285535726,_edit_last  => 1,
12	New Languages	May 5, 2010	post	Uncategorized,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/uncategorized/12/	In preparing for mono.mono//stereo I searched for something that would make images that I wanted. I started with Processing but once I started adding some effects it got way too slow so I found Quartz Composer. I ended up using that for the piece. That introduced a lot of communication problems. OSC is not implemented well and there are a lot of resets and bogus reports. The same data sent to any other program looks just fine. I am looking to leave Quartz and move to another language. What I can't find is a good language for drawing in 3D with a list of arbitrary coordinates.So, I have been thinking about going back to Processing or checking out Field. Field has a lot of nice bridges to Max/MSP and some incredible hybrid code/gui functions. It also binds with python nicely so I could integrate marsyas and some other systems pretty easily. Could this be the glue I am looking for?I am still searching. I have some time coming up and I think I will play with it a bit and report back.	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1273071942,_edit_last  => 1,
15	Banff Residency	August 2, 2010	post	Uncategorized,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/uncategorized/15/	I am on a Residency with Jordan Tate in Banff to work on my visual competency and I am teaching Jordan about programming and digital media.Jordan's first assignment is to make 10 animated gifs in response to other work. Here is part one. This is called 4'33". I recently saw Rauschenberg's "White Paintings" at SFMOMA and I was really taken. I love minimalism. I found out through some reading that Cage didn't really go for the full 4'33" until he saw these. I like black so I made a black animated gif with various degrees of black. I did this because Cage discovered that you can't ever experience silence, there is always some noise and jitter. http://www.emvergeoning.com/?p=1095<hr><pre>// TITLE: 4'33"// Adam Tindale 2010// http://www.emvergeoning.com/?p=1095import gifAnimation.*;GifMaker gifExport;PImage mygif;color[] c = new color [3];int i = 0;void setup(){  gifExport = new GifMaker(this, "export.gif"); gifExport.setRepeat(0);  c[0] =  color(0); c[1] =  color(3); c[2] =  color(5); }void draw(){ background(c[i]); gifExport.setDelay(1); gifExport.addFrame();  if (i == 2){  gifExport.finish();   exit(); }  i = ++i % 3;}</pre><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/export.gif"><img src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/export.gif" alt="" title="export" width="100" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16" /></a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_last  => 1,_edit_lock  => 1280804684,_oembed_7a5c80988eeb8effe00f24817ea00aa4  => {{unknown}},_wp_old_slug  => ,

21	Motion Study	August 3, 2010	post	Uncategorized,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/uncategorized/21/	I took a bunch of pictures and then pasted them together with<code>convert $(ls *JPG | sort -n -r) $(ls *JPG | sort -n) -layers OptimizePlus paper.gif</code>convert is a tool from the free ImageMagick package. The sort command organizes the files into numerical order (great for those file names that cameras tend to import). The -r flag reverses the set in the first sequences and then I remove it for the second sequence so it loops nicely. Again, you may have to click on the picture and let it load a second before you get a nicely looping image. <a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/papersmall.gif"><img src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/papersmall.gif" alt="" title="papersmall" width="160" height="120" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23" /></a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1280879482,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
24	Gearing Up for Creative Pact 2010	August 28, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/24/	Finally I am going to be staying at home for some length of time. I have a few goals for the next few months to forward my practice. I need to improve my <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing.org</a> skills and learn some new tricks to get my next project done. To that end I am committing to the Creative Pact 2010 in order to keep myself motivated. Every day in September I will put up a new post about something creative I have done in Processing. I was thinking that every post would be audio + visuals but I think I am going to keep it manageable. I don't know if I will have more than an hour a day to be creative since school starts soon. Weekends will likely have bigger projects, as I will have more time on those days.I am hoping to learn some more about Minim, controlP5, GLGraphics and OpenGL in general as I create this stuff. For all you Processing experts watching please comment and show me how to improve my code, coding, and inspiration for visuals. Even links to things would be super helpful.I am going to build a few tools for the next few days so I can take some screenshots and videos easily to post for y'all. I will put them here in case they are useful for you too.	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1283014683,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,

27	Oâ€™Reilly Class	August 31, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/27/	I enrolled for the O'Reilly class on Processing and Arduino and it starts in 30 minutes. I am hoping that it becomes useful. I do like controlP5 as a library for guis. In the meantime I did a few utils. I have an easy save mechanism thanks to saveFrame() in Processing. I also have some sketch code for recording video. Surely this will change over the month but these are things that I thought would be important to start. I think I may also start a template sketch so I can get straight to my idea. I'll be sure to put it up if I get to it. <pre>import processing.video.*;MovieMaker mm;  // Declare MovieMaker object/*// copy to setup() to activate mm = new MovieMaker(this, width, height, "mysketchoutput.mov",                       frameRate, MovieMaker.H263, MovieMaker.HIGH);// copy to the end of draw() mm.addFrame();*/void captureEvent(Capture myCapture) {  myCapture.read();}void mouseReleased(){   println(frameRate); }void keyPressed(){ if(key == ' ')  saveFrame();  if (key == 'f')  println(frameRate);    if(key == 's' & mm != null)     mm.finish();}</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1283290501,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,

I borrowed some code from a Minim example and a <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=6656">sketch</a> from <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/">OpenProcessing.org</a>.I used the RMS values from the audio buffer to determine the sound and location of each plot.

35	Day 3	September 3, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/35/	Today was a challenge. I downloaded the BETA of MINM so that I could try the new UGEN api. It is interesting but not fully featured yet. I saw a Granulator in there and I got excited. I wasn't able to make any good sounds and I ran into some troubles with controlP5 and MINIM where they both had Controller classes and Events. There is a crazy solution where the name of a controlP5 object can be declared as a global and the slider will update the global. I have to look further into why this works but it certainly minimizes the amount of code I have to write to make a basic GUI.This example does a simple mapping of the BitCrush UGEN with a slider. It also has a display for the audio output. I would love to have access to the audio input too. More work to be done. I am learning a lot here.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0109.tif"><img src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0109.tif" alt="" title="screen-0109" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36" /></a><br><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0731.tif"><img src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0731.tif" alt="" title="screen-0731" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37" /></a><hr><pre>import ddf.minim.*;import ddf.minim.ugens.*;import controlP5.*;ControlP5 controlP5;Slider bdslider;public float bitdepth;Minim minim;LiveInput in;AudioOutput out;Constant controls = new Constant();BitCrush fx1 = new BitCrush();void setup(){  size(500, 400);  minim = new Minim(this);  out = minim.getLineOut();  in = new LiveInput( minim.getInputStream(out.getFormat().getChannels(), out.bufferSize(), out.sampleRate(), out.getFormat().getSampleSizeInBits()) );     controlP5 = new ControlP5(this);  bdslider = controlP5.addSlider("bitdepth",1,16,  15,height/3-80 , width-100,30);  bdslider.setValue(8);    controls.patch(fx1.bitRes);  controls.setConstant (bitdepth);  in.patch(fx1).patch(out);}void draw(){  background(50);  stroke( 255 );    controls.setConstant (bitdepth);     for( int i = 0; i < out.bufferSize() - 1; i++ )  {    float x1  =  map( i, 0, out.bufferSize(), 0, width );    float x2  =  map( i+1, 0, out.bufferSize(), 0, width );    line( x1, height*.75 + out.left.get(i)*50, x2, height*.75 + out.left.get(i+1)*50);    line( x1, height*.75 + 50 + out.right.get(i)*50, x2, height*.75 + 50 + out.right.get(i+1)*50);  }    controlP5.draw(); }void keyPressed(){  if (key == ' ')    saveFrame();}void stop(){  in.close();  out.close();  minim.stop();  super.stop();}</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1283545484,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
38	Day 4	September 4, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/38/	This one has been in the works for awhile. I have been looking at the minim BETA for a few days and now I feel like I am getting my head around it. Today I made my first UGen. I think I am going to submit it to the distribution. It is a byte swapping algorithm inspired by swap~ in zexy for PD. This is one of my favourite distortions. Very loud and very nasty. You've been warned.Today I also finally delved into Processing's method for exporting applets. So, I am not going to dump a whole lot of code in this post. If you want to see the code follow the links below.The audio display is rendered as points. This is inspired by something I saw at MUTEK this year and is also the flavour of the visual material for Frank Bretschneider's EXP. <a href="http://www.frankbretschneider.de/Web-Site/exp.html">http://www.frankbretschneider.de/Web-Site/exp.html</a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0589.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39" title="screen-0589" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0589.tif" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-1116.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40" title="screen-1116" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-1116.tif" alt="" /></a><hr />Today's Code:<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/code/processing/creativepact2010/DAY4/">http://www.adamtindale.com/code/processing/creativepact2010/DAY4/</a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1283634585,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
41	Day 5	September 6, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/41/	Today I was working with analysis. This patch doesn't have a lot of good looks but I have implemented a zero crossing rate function, an rms function for time domain analysis, spectral centroid, spectral rolloff, and spectral compactness. I coded up a spectral flatness measure but I keep getting zero as the output. I haven't done thorough debugging job because I was trying to make sure I have something done for today!I started out hoping that I could implement both the spectral features and time domain features as an AudioListener object but the FFT object doesn't work that way. So, I made a method that is called every draw loop. This isn't the nicest solution but it works. I am dreaming up a link between <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/jAudio.html">jAudio</a> and MINIM. If I'm not careful I might be putting another thing on my plate :)Today's patch is really just an extension of MINIM's spectral display patch but an overlay of the feature extraction output. My hope is to eventually do a MINIM version of <a href="http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/software/sndpeek/">sndpeek</a>. Maybe tomorrow there will be text and waterfall plots... maybe.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0175.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42" title="screen-0175" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0175.tif" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0568.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43" title="screen-0568" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0568.tif" alt="" /></a><hr />Today's code:<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/code/processing/creativepact2010/DAY5/">http://www.adamtindale.com/code/processing/creativepact2010/DAY5/</a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1283744206,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
45	Day 6	September 6, 2010	post	Uncategorized,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/uncategorized/45/	Last night I finished watching the first season of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/">The Wire</a>. I have been watching it on DVD and the splash screen and the opening scene of the show has all of these signal displays. So, I dusted off my trigonometry skills and started making some sine waves dance on my screen.I have some ideas about how to tweak this a bit more by casting the shapes to PImages and then applying filters but I have a busy day, so that will happen another time. I expect that the sketches during the week will be shorter than the weekend ones. I think that is just how it goes.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0264.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46" title="screen-0264" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0264.tif" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0342.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47" title="screen-0342" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0342.tif" alt="" /></a><hr />Today's Code:<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/code/processing/creativepact2010/DAY6">www.adamtindale.com/code/processing/creativepact2010/DAY6</a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_last  => 1,_edit_lock  => 1283792302,_wp_old_slug  => ,

I have a sphere here that is rotated by making a loud sound. I have done a rather crude thresholding but I discovered that MINIM has a nice level() call on audiobuffers that return the RMS. Hooray!I also discovered that on a mac when you export your patch to the web it doesn't work well if you are using OPENGL. I have included the code inline with the blog, which I don't like so much but it will get the idea to you.Like I predicted this is a much shorter sketch than on the weekends. This is going to be the way of it until I get more efficient at my changing weeks.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0107.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50" title="screen-0107" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0107.tif" alt="" width="864" height="540" /></a><hr /><pre>import ddf.minim.*;import processing.opengl.*;import javax.media.opengl.*;Minim minim;AudioInput input;float r;float inc;void setup(){  size(screen.width, screen.height, OPENGL);  hint(ENABLE_OPENGL_4X_SMOOTH);  minim = new Minim(this);  input = minim.getLineIn(Minim.STEREO, 512);  stroke(255, 255, 150);  noFill();}void draw(){  background(30);  float audiolevel = input.mix.level();  if (audiolevel &gt; 0.01)    inc++;  r = r + inc;  inc = inc * 0.85;  translate (width/2, height/2,mouseX);  rotateY(r);  sphere(200 + audiolevel*1000);}void keyPressed(){   if (key == ' ')   {      saveFrame();   }}void stop(){  input.close();  minim.stop();  super.stop();}</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1283911703,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
52	Day 8	September 9, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/52/	Another audio analysis simple patch for today. I looked into the BeatDetect object in MINIM and found that yesterday's code could be done even simpler by using the built in detector. It isn't very good but it works. I didn't do much tweaking on it but I bet with some massaging I could get it to detect my signals a little bit better.So today's patch is a bit of a homage to <a href="http://processing.org/learning/library/spacejunk.html">Dan Shiffman's space junk patch</a>. The patch has three magic lines that make it look great. The last three valid lines are rotatings in x,y,z. What makes it special is that those lines are repeated multiple times in each frame and a translate is performed afterwards with no pushMatrix() or popMatrix(). So the reference is moved about the sketch multiple times so that there is some interesting placement of objects about the space.This patch uses the detected volume and onset information to draw a set of shapes around the screen with varying rotation based upon the detected parameters. On my machine the frames show up for a very short amount of time and often aren't drawn fully so it looks quite glitchy and nice. When I render it out to screenshots the image is preserved. Try squinting and covering half the image in a weird way and you will see what I see when it is running, or run the code yourself.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0707.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" title="screen-0707" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0707.tif" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-5458.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-54" title="screen-5458" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-5458.tif" alt="" /></a><hr><pre>import ddf.minim.*;import ddf.minim.analysis.*;import processing.opengl.*;import javax.media.opengl.*;Minim minim;AudioInput input;BeatDetect detectorGadget;void setup(){  size(640,480,OPENGL);    minim = new Minim(this);  input = minim.getLineIn(Minim.STEREO, 512);  detectorGadget = new BeatDetect();   stroke(255, 255, 150); fill(3,190,129);}void draw(){  background(30);  float audiolevel = input.mix.level();  detectorGadget.detect(input.mix);    translate (width/2, height/2,200);  if(detectorGadget.isOnset())  {    for (int i = 0 ; i < 100; i++)    {      ellipse(0,0, 1000*audiolevel,1000*audiolevel);      box(10,10,100);      rotate(audiolevel);      translate(log(audiolevel),0);    }  }}void keyPressed(){   if (key == ' ')     {      saveFrame();   }}void stop(){  input.close();  minim.stop();  super.stop();}</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1284002921,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,

So I have come home and tried to do something before I go to sleep. This is my first sketch that is a continuation of the day before.I was looking at things and thinking about in-between. I have made a simple patch that takes yesterday's patch but adds a cloud of random points and I can do linear interpolation between the two. It is crude right now but there are some very interesting intermediate states between objects that arrive. I have also properly implemented the Dan Shiffman sugar from his space junk sketch so I get some more variation from frame to frame.Again, OPENGL so code will follow the image, now animated.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/day101.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62" title="day10" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/day101.gif" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><hr /><pre>import ddf.minim.*;import ddf.minim.analysis.*;import processing.opengl.*;import javax.media.opengl.*;Minim minim;AudioInput input;int Segments = 21;float[][] mylines = new float[Segments*Segments][3];float[][] myrandomlines = new float[Segments*Segments][3];float theta;float phi;float scalething = 200;int r = 1;int p;color c1 = color(240,0,0);color c2 = color (20,150,150);void setup(){  size(640,480, OPENGL);  minim = new Minim(this);  input = minim.getLineIn(Minim.STEREO, 512);  for(int i=0; i < Segments;++i){theta = (float)i/Segments * 2 * PI;for(int j=0; j < Segments;++j){phi = (float)j/Segments * PI;mylines[i*Segments+j][0] = sin(theta)*cos(phi)*scalething;mylines[i*Segments+j][1] = sin(theta)*sin(phi)*scalething;mylines[i*Segments+j][2] = cos(theta)*scalething;                                    myrandomlines[i*Segments+j][0] = random(0,scalething) - scalething/2;                        myrandomlines[i*Segments+j][1] = random(0,scalething) - scalething/2;                        myrandomlines[i*Segments+j][2] = random(0,scalething) - scalething/2;}}  }void draw(){   background(200);  translate(width/2, height/2);    float audiolevel = input.mix.level();  strokeWeight(audiolevel*100);  c1 = color(audiolevel*2100,80,audiolevel*1400);  rotateY((float)p/200);  rotateZ((float)p/123);  for(int i = 1 ; i < Segments * Segments; i++)  {      rotate(random(200));      beginShape(LINES);         stroke(c1);          vertex(mylines[i][0] * (1.0 - 1.0/r) + myrandomlines[i][0] * (1.0/r),             mylines[i][1] * (1.0 - 1.0/r) + myrandomlines[i][1] * (1.0/r),             mylines[i][2] * (1.0 - 1.0/r) + myrandomlines[i][2] * (1.0/r));         stroke(c2);          vertex(mylines[i-1][0] * (1.0 - 1.0/r) + myrandomlines[i-1][0] * (1.0/r),            mylines[i-1][1] * (1.0 - 1.0/r) + myrandomlines[i-1][1] * (1.0/r),           mylines[i-1][2]* (1.0 - 1.0/r) + myrandomlines[i-1][2] * (1.0/r) );      endShape();  }}void keyPressed(){   if (key == ' ')     {      saveFrame();   }}void mouseClicked(){ r++;   }void stop(){  input.close();  minim.stop();  super.stop();}</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1284180862,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
63	Day 11	September 12, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/63/	Today was a bit of a bust. I tried writing some GLSL shaders using <a href="http://glgraphics.sourceforge.net">GLGraphics</a> and didn't have much luck. I have been wanting to dig into the library for awhile but haven't had time, so today was the day. I was able to get some simple frag shaders going but blurs weren't working. I upgraded to the new version only to find new functionality came with a new API. The patch I made works but crashes after 10 seconds or so. When I have more time I will look further into the issue or post it on the forums but for now I just have a day to make something.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/glitch.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64" title="glitch" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/glitch.gif" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1284264939,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
65	Day 12	September 12, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/65/	I was again playing with GLGraphics and had a happy accident. I added some more shaders to a sketch and got these swirling worlds. I think this is something I am going to keep. I did something I thought I understood and came up with these great visuals for some reason. This illustrates to me that I need a little more theory before I dig deeper with shaders. Some other time.My big problem is that I haven't added audio so I am diverting a bit from my original idea at the beginning of the month.  Tomorrow I will refocus.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0789.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-66" title="screen-0789" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0789.tif" alt="" width="384" height="288" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-14122.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-67" title="screen-14122" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-14122.tif" alt="" width="384" height="288" /></a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1284322929,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
69	Day 13	September 14, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/69/	Today I am working with a visual idea that I want to turn into music. I have a blurry scene where the action moves up and a sine wave moves down. It is a start.I am using a stack blur from <a href="http://incubator.quasimondo.com/processing/stackblur.pde">quasimondo</a>. It is super fast and it looks ok. Not quite as pleasurable as a gaussian but way faster. I also got bit on a pointer reference thing when converting a PGraphics to a PImage. Be careful! PGraphics is a subclass of PImage and you can assign one to the other thanks to inheritance but to copy the actual image from one to the other you have to use the get() method  and then things will behave like you expect.

84	Day 18	September 18, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/84/	Today I messed around with some simple spectral displays and trying other parts of the Processing API. I have added curveVertex to my bag of tricks. This patch has two curvy lissajous spectral displays rotating in contrary motion and a set of bars representing linear spectral averages.This was the first time I put some more interaction into a sketch. I have a key that changes the mode of the layering. I have been working on things and discovering stuff that I like about a sketch but often it goes away when I make the final thing that I like most. So, I made a little mistake in the process and kept it as an option by pressing the d key.I still have to look into waterfall plots and buffering. Maybe tomorrow.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0581.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85" title="screen-0581" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0581.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0786.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86" title="screen-0786" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0786.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><hr /><pre>import ddf.minim.*;import ddf.minim.analysis.*;Minim minim;AudioInput input;FFT fft;boolean darkness = false;int r;void setup(){  size(720,480,P2D);  smooth();  minim = new Minim(this);  input = minim.getLineIn(Minim.STEREO);  fft = new FFT(input.bufferSize(), input.sampleRate() );  fft.linAverages(10);  background(0);}void draw(){  fft.forward(input.mix);  noStroke();  fill(0,19);  rect(0,0,width,height);  stroke(input.mix.level() * 255);  strokeWeight(.1);  pushMatrix();  translate(width/4,height/4);  rotate(PI - (float)r/100);  beginShape();  for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; fft.avgSize(); i++)  {      fill( fft.getBand(i) * 255 , 40);      curveVertex(sin ( (float)i/fft.avgSize() * 2 *TWO_PI) *fft.getBand(i)  * width/2 , cos( (float)i/fft.avgSize() * 2 * TWO_PI) * fft.getBand(i)  * height/2  );  }  endShape(CLOSE);  popMatrix();  pushMatrix();  translate(width/4*3,height/4*3);  rotate(PI + (float)r++/100);  beginShape();  for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; fft.avgSize(); i++)  {      fill( fft.getBand(i) * 255 , 40);      curveVertex(sin ( (float)i/fft.avgSize() * 2 *TWO_PI) *fft.getBand(i)  * width/2 , cos( (float)i/fft.avgSize() * 2 * TWO_PI) * fft.getBand(i)  * height/2  );  }  endShape(CLOSE);  popMatrix();  int spacing = width / fft.avgSize();  if (!darkness)    stroke(180);  for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; fft.avgSize(); i++)  {     strokeWeight(fft.getBand(i) * 50);     line( spacing * i + spacing/2, 0, spacing * i + spacing/2, height);  }}void stop(){  input.close();  minim.stop();  super.stop();}void keyPressed(){ if (key == ' ')  saveFrame();  if (key == 'd' | key == 'D' )  darkness = !darkness;}</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_last  => 1,_edit_lock  => 1284854124,_wp_old_slug  => ,
88	Day 19	September 19, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/88/	I was hoping to have some success with ArrayLists today but I didn't. I finally have the waterfall code down but it goes backwards from past to present instead of present to past. It looks kinda neat this way, though. I also added colour! For me,  working in HSB seems to be more closely related to my headspace than RGB, so if I need colour I am going to stick to that for now.This sketch uses linear averages of FFT which are really easy to compute and set up but the result is less than pleasing. I think tomorrow I will play with the log function and see if I can get something a little closer to what I think it should look like.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0090.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89" title="screen-0090" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0090.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0841.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90" title="screen-0841" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0841.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><hr><pre>import ddf.minim.*;import ddf.minim.analysis.*;import javax.media.opengl.*;import processing.opengl.*;Minim minim;AudioInput input;FFT fft;float[][] spectra;int pointer;void setup(){    size(720,480,OPENGL);   hint(ENABLE_OPENGL_4X_SMOOTH);  smooth();  minim = new Minim(this);   input = minim.getLineIn(Minim.STEREO);  fft = new FFT(input.bufferSize(), input.sampleRate() );     fft.linAverages(10);    spectra = new float[50][fft.avgSize()];    colorMode(HSB,1000);}void draw(){  camera(width/2.0, height/10.0, (height/2.0) / tan(PI*60.0 / 360.0), width/2.0, height/2.0, 0, 0, 1, 0);    fft.forward(input.mix);    for (int i = 0 ; i < fft.avgSize() ; i++)    spectra[ pointer ][i] = fft.getAvg(i);    background(0);    noFill();    translate(0,height - 100);    for ( int q = 1 ; q <= 50 ; q++)  {      stroke(200,1000 - (q*20), 1000 - (q*20) );      beginShape();    for (int i = 0 ; i < fft.avgSize() ; i++)      curveVertex(i * (float)width/10 , spectra[ (pointer+q) % 50 ][i] * height );    endShape();      translate(0,0, -200);  }    pointer = (pointer + 1) % 50;}void keyPressed(){  if (key == ' ')    saveFrame(); }</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1285127624,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,

I was thinking of making something that might look like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone">Shepard's Tone</a> and I came up with this simple idea of a complex polygon that expands outwards into the viewer. I got it going and then I thought it would be cool for it to be endless. I will have to think how I can do that practically. I have a feeling it will borrow some waterfall code and test to see if vertices are out of visual range and then put them back into the pile.

This was something I was thinking of as a way to illustrate mono signals and then I could modify the images as the signals diverged. I played around with rotating a bit and then remembered that it could get ugly and convoluted so I did a bit of googling and the Processing forums showed a gem: scale(). I can set the scale to negative values in either the x or y dimension (or z if you want to get crazy) and then move the image accordingly and all is fine.I set up minim to blend a noise image into my scene if there is an onset and then I played around with rotating boxes again.

I used the spectral feature extraction from Day 5 so not all of the code is posted below. You can go to that post and rip the features if you like.This sketch uses a more coherent model instead of randomness. There are 20 3D boxes in the sketch that have their colour and placement changed based upon the sound coming into the sketch. It is reactive but a little too literal. I think I will try to make some mappings in the future that can take spectral centroids and do something meaningful visually.

111	Day 26	September 26, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/111/	I guess I am at it again. Today I was playing around with an idea for making a spectral centroid visual. I was thinking about FFT displays and I thought that having bars rise and fall isn't all that visually stimulating, though it is accurate for display. So, what I did was map spectral centroid to the location of a directional light in OPENGL and had it point to a line of boxes whose size modulates with the amplitude of the incoming signal. I also reversed the amplitude mapping so that loud sounds create small boxes. It makes for some nice motion.I also spent some time looking through the Processing.org bug list in reference to some glitchyness in OPENGL as implemented in Processing. There are varying reports about how to smooth out anti-aliasing and threading issues. It seems the best thing to do is to try out all solutions and see which one works for that particular patch. Although the simplest thing to do to avoid the anti-aliasing problem is to only draw vertical or horizontal lines, but who wants to do that?<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0754.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-112" title="screen-0754" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0754.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-1271.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-113" title="screen-1271" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-1271.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><hr><pre>import javax.media.opengl.*;import processing.opengl.*;import ddf.minim.*;import ddf.minim.analysis.*;Minim minim;AudioInput in;FFT fft;float r;float zr;float lastlevel;float[]  myspectrum;float[] features;void setup(){  size(720, 480, OPENGL);  //http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=217&q=opengl&colspec=Stars%20ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Owner%20Summary  //http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=53&q=opengl&colspec=Stars%20ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Owner%20Summary  //noSmooth();  hint( DISABLE_OPENGL_2X_SMOOTH );  hint( ENABLE_OPENGL_4X_SMOOTH );  //smooth();    minim = new Minim(this);  in = minim.getLineIn(Minim.STEREO, 512);    fft = new FFT(in.bufferSize(), in.sampleRate());  myspectrum = new float[ in.bufferSize() ];  fill(200, 40);  stroke(30,40);}void draw(){  background(30);  lights();  fft.forward(in.mix);  for(int i= 0; i < fft.specSize(); i++)    myspectrum[i] = fft.getBand(i);    //==============================  // SPECTRAL CENTROID  //==============================  float m1 = 0;  float m0 = 0;  for (int i = 0; i < myspectrum.length; i++){    m1 += i * myspectrum[i];    m0 += myspectrum[i];   }  float centroid = 0.5;  if (m0 != 0.0)  {    centroid = (m1 / m0) / (float) myspectrum.length ;    }  //==============================    float level = in.mix.level();  // lowpass filter to smooth out motion  level += lastlevel;  level *= 0.5;  translate( width/2 , height/2 );  rotateX ( zr++ / 50 );  // set range of centroid to -1 -> 1  directionalLight( 200,100,230, centroid * 2 -1 ,0,-1 );    float spacing = (float)width / fft.specSize() ;  float boxsize = 10;  for ( int i = 0 ; i < fft.specSize() ; i++ )  {     pushMatrix();    translate( (i * spacing) - (width/2) + boxsize - 10 ,0,0);    box(boxsize - 10*log(level) - 30);    popMatrix();  }    lastlevel = level;}void stop(){  in.close();  minim.stop();  super.stop();}void mouseClicked(){   saveFrame(); }</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_last  => 1,_edit_lock  => 1285523991,_wp_old_slug  => ,
114	Day 27	September 27, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/114/	Another day, another experiment. I tried to resurrect my Spectral Flatness code and I think it is a precision error in the geometric mean. I thought about scaling the FFT values but I will have to go back on the math for that to make sure I don't skew the values the wrong way. For now I have used the arithmetic mean of the spectrum to give me some numbers to play with.This sketch changes colour at different volumes, currently white for quiet and black for loud, and becomes more animated with noisier spectra (not really but close enough for now). I think I am getting close to something interesting. Maybe once I sleep on it tomorrow will show me the answer.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0214.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116" title="screen-0214" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0214.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0146.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117" title="screen-0146" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0146.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><hr /><pre>import javax.media.opengl.*;import processing.opengl.*;import ddf.minim.*;import ddf.minim.analysis.*;Minim minim;AudioInput in;FFT fft;float lastlevel;float[]  myspectrum;float[] features;float spacing;void setup(){  size(720, 480, OPENGL);  hint( DISABLE_OPENGL_2X_SMOOTH );  smooth();    minim = new Minim(this);  in = minim.getLineIn(Minim.STEREO, 512);    fft = new FFT(in.bufferSize(), in.sampleRate());  fft.logAverages(50, 2);  myspectrum = new float[ in.bufferSize() ];  noFill();  strokeWeight(8);    spacing = (float) width / fft.avgSize();  }void draw(){  background(30);    fft.forward(in.mix);  float sum = 0;  for(int i= 0; i < in.bufferSize(); i++)  {    myspectrum[i] = fft.getBand(i);    sum += myspectrum[i];  }    //==============================  // SPECTRAL FLATNESS  // DOESN'T WORK -- geometric mean always evaluates to zero :(  //==============================  float flatness = 0;  double geometricMean = (double) myspectrum[0];  float arithmeticMean = sum;  for ( int i = 1; i < myspectrum.length; i++)  {        geometricMean *= (double) myspectrum[i];        if (myspectrum[i] == 0.0)        {          println("WARNING: ZERO DETECTED " +frameCount);          break; // might as well leave since this thing will evaluate to zero        }  }  geometricMean = Math.pow(geometricMean , (1.0f / myspectrum.length) );  arithmeticMean /=  myspectrum.length;  flatness = (float)geometricMean / arithmeticMean ;    //==============================    float level = in.mix.level();  // lowpass filter to smooth out motion  level += lastlevel;  level *= 0.5;  translate( width/2 , height/2 );  if (10 * log(level) > -50 )    stroke(0);  else    stroke ( 200, 40);  beginShape();  for ( int i = 0 ; i < fft.avgSize() ; i++ )     curveVertex( random(-spacing, spacing) * i, arithmeticMean * random(50,150) - 75 , random (0, -200) );  endShape();    lastlevel = level;}void stop(){  in.close();  minim.stop();  super.stop();}void mouseClicked(){   saveFrame(); }</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1285613901,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,
118	Day 28	September 29, 2010	post	Creative Pact 2010,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/creativepact2010/118/	I am getting quite interested in developing some analysis tools for sound in Java. I am wanting to find the ratio of centre frequency to noise. Today I made a crude algorithm that looks for the peak frequency bin and then uses that in a ratio between spectral centroid. If the peak is off from the centroid then you can assume a distribution that is noisier (aka less pitched). The problems with this algorithm is that it is not normalized to volume and that a centroid of fftsize/2 is noise so if there is a peak at this place then you will get erroneous data. That will take me a little while to find a good solution around this but if was a fun thought experiment.Today's patch uses my peakiness measure to draw big bubbles across the screen. More noisy means more crazy drawing. It is actually responding in generally the right way and is kind of interesting to watch. I will definitely be expanding on this idea.Also today I left in some comments in the code for things that I tried and abandoned. You can see a bit more into my process with these.<a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0611.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-119" title="screen-0611" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0611.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0969.tif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-120" title="screen-0969" src="http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-0969.tif" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></a><hr /><pre>import javax.media.opengl.*;import processing.opengl.*;import ddf.minim.*;import ddf.minim.analysis.*;Minim minim;AudioInput in;FFT fft;void setup(){  size(720, 480);  background ( 0 ) ;  smooth();    minim = new Minim(this);  in = minim.getLineIn(Minim.STEREO, 512);  fft = new FFT(in.bufferSize(), in.sampleRate());  fft.noAverages();}void draw(){  ///------------------------  // SPECTRAL PEAKINESS  ///------------------------  // made this up. not accurate but gives interesting data  fft.forward(in.mix);  float sum = fft.getBand(0);  int peak = 0;  float centroid = 0;    for( int i = 1 ; i < fft.specSize() ; i++)  {    sum += fft.getBand(i);    centroid += i * fft.getBand(i);    if ( fft.getBand(i) > fft.getBand(peak) )        peak = i;  }  centroid /= sum;  float peakiness = (float) peak / centroid;  ///------------------------    noStroke();  fill(0,6);  rect ( 0,0, width, height );    translate(width/2, height/2);  fill(200,60);  for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++)  {     float circlesize = random(70,100);     //ellipse ( random(random(-200,-20), random(50,200)), random(random(-200,-20), random(50,200)) , circlesize, circlesize );    ellipse ( random(-width/2, width/2), random(random(-200,-20), random(50,200)) * peakiness, circlesize, circlesize );  }    //filter(BLUR, peakiness);}void stop(){  in.close();  minim.stop();  super.stop();}void mouseClicked(){   saveFrame(); }</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_last  => 1,_edit_lock  => 1285729332,_wp_old_slug  => ,

I borrowed some of the code from yesterday and tried to make it a bit more gradual and I got some interesting results.I also spent some time today digging into the Java API and found some nice features of Arrays. Sorting is actually quite a nice algorithm and also fill is a great way to just fill up an array with a value.

129	Creating Masks in Processing.org	November 17, 2010	post	Processing,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/processing/129/	A great tutorial on OffScreen graphics rendering on <a href="http://blog.blprnt.com/">http://blog.blprnt.com/</a> made me want to release some code today. I have been working on some offscreen graphics rendering to create masking effects for an upcoming performance. Processing offers PImage and PGraphics as objects that hold raw pixels or vector graphics. These are kept somewhere in memory and not drawn to the screen unless you put them there using <a href="http://processing.org/reference/image_.html">image()</a>. This is much faster than drawing to the screen in almost every instance. Using the<a href="http://processing.org/reference/blend_.html"> blend()</a> command with the MULTIPLY option you can apply a masking effect to your sketch. For the example below the mask is a PGraphics object that contains a line which scrolls down the screen. Since the background is set to black (or 0) when it is multiplied against the image drawn on the screen it becomes black (because anything times 0 is 0). If this example is working properly you should see a red line move down the screen. This is because the image drawn to the screen is just a red background. <hr><pre>PGraphics g;int x;void setup(){  size( 720, 480);  // create the mask  g = createGraphics(width,height, P2D);}  void draw(){  background(244,90,10);  // draw the mask  g.beginDraw();  g.background(0);  g.stroke(255);  g.line(0, x%height, g.width, x++%height);  g.endDraw();  // apply the mask to the screen  blend(g,0,0, width,height, 0,0,width,height,MULTIPLY);}</pre>If you'd like to get fancy you can draw your image and mask offscreen and then send the result to the screen. Here is a little code snippet to get you started on your journey.<hr><pre>PImage img;Pgraphics msk;//.... do some drawing in both// apply the mask to the image, both offscreenimg.blend(msk, 0,0,img.height, img.width, 0,0,img.width,img.height,MULTIPLY);// draw the masked image to the screenimage(img,0,0,width,height);</pre>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1290010295,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,

I really like doing sprint work, like Creative Pact 2010 in September, so I have decided to make my own theme: Documentation. This week I am going to write a new post every day with documentation of what I have been doing in the past few months. I have been playing with software and hardware and doing some shows. You will get a little taste of that in different forms every day this week. I hope you find something that you like!	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_last  => 1,_edit_lock  => 1298218223,_wp_old_slug  => ,

However a recording is both, a recording lays dormant ready to be performed. Record itself is both a noun and verb until it is contextualized in language.

Weaving innovative choreography, sophisticated video manipulation and sound together, The Open Spaces Project presents a multilayered essay on people and space.</p><div><strong>Videos</strong></div><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ox7IZPovU3w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eQX9SZlueZw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><strong>Sound Track</strong><object height="81" width="100%"> <param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11021891"></param> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="81" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11021891" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%"></embed> </object>  <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/adamtindale/open-spaces-project-trio">Open Spaces Project - Trio</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/adamtindale">adamtindale</a></span> <object height="81" width="100%"> <param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11022308&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700"></param> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="81" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11022308&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%"></embed> </object>   <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/adamtindale/open-spaces-project-working">Open Spaces Project - Working</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/adamtindale">adamtindale</a></span><object height="81" width="100%"> <param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11022584&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700"></param> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="81" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11022584&amp;show_comments=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%"></embed> </object>   <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/adamtindale/open-spaces-project-opening">Open Spaces Project - Opening</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/adamtindale">adamtindale</a></span><strong>Reviews</strong><a href="http://www.straight.com/article-273832/vancouver/machinoisys-open-spaces-project-feels-happening">http://www.straight.com/article-273832/vancouver/machinoisys-open-spaces-project-feels-happening</a><a href="http://www.straight.com/article-273106/vancouver/architects-dance">http://www.straight.com/article-273106/vancouver/architects-dance</a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1298596231:1,_edit_last  => 1,_wp_old_slug  => ,

142	Applescript + iTunes = Simple Functionality Added	April 10, 2011	post	Uncategorized,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/uncategorized/142/	I like listening to music. I prefer when the song finishes. I don't want to stay hovering over iTunes for the end of the song. There isn't a button to do this but we do have Applescript. Here is the hard way to do it.<pre>tell application "iTunes"if player state is playing thenif selection is not current track thenreveal current track -- reveal selects current track...end ifplay selection with onceend ifend tell</pre>Thanks to <a href="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/info03.php">Doug's Applescript for iTunes reference for the reveal command.</a>	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_lock  => 1302467954:1,_edit_last  => 1,
144	A real blog post	May 9, 2011	post	Uncategorized,		http://www.adamtindale.com/blog/uncategorized/144/	Isn't a blog supposed to be about the musings of the blogger? I have done a lot of reporting of projects that I have finished. This summer I am going to try and post more works in progress and expose process a little more.As an artist I try to just get things done. I rarely focus on code quality while developing and when a project works I almost never clean up the code for others to look at it. I'll try and fix that this summer. I have been playing with <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> to help me explore my code over time and look at the development of code by some other art practitioners.I have also been investigating <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a> as a CMS. Right now, my website uses <a href="http://www.indexhibit.org/">indexhibit</a> for the main site and a wordpress install for the blog. I am looking for a system that do everything and integrate with everything. I looked at <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> once, but we mostly didn't get along.You may have noticed <a href="http://www.adamtindale.com/html5/">my html5 experiment</a> for the website. My problem with handrolling a site, besides the obvious, is compatibility. I'd love to have a site that changed to an appropriate form for every platform that happened to land here. I would like a wild animation if your browser could handle it, and something more simple yet interesting for iPhones, lower end Android devices, and all of the other <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/internet_fridges.php">interesting things that are now on the internet.</a>I don't have comments enabled on this blog. If you have ideas or comments send me an email or hit me up on twitter. I'd prefer to talk in public so let's talk on twitter. Let's try #fixadamswebsite for the tag to keep the conversation together. Be patient with me though, I am thinking that revamping my website will take the next 4 months.http://twitter.com/adamtindaleOver the summer I will update my website to help you few readers to get what you want from this place a little easier and more relevant as you explore. I'll also clean up my code and make it easier for you to find so you can use it or investigate it.	adamtindale	adamrtindale@gmail.com	_edit_last  => 1,_edit_lock  => 1304963001:1,
