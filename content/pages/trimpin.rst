Trimpin's Turntables
====================

Trimpin, the famous sound sculptor, brought his musical turntable robots to the University of Victoria and left them for two months to allow students to deeply explore them. During this time I currated the exhibit locally and provided initial training to all particpants, as well as giving demos for interested researchers.

My short performance utilizes a game controller and Max/MSP to send MIDI messages to the robots. Various Wagner records were used as source material.
