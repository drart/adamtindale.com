Colin Labadie + Adam Tindale Duo
--------------------------------

- Colin Labadie - Electronic Guitar
- Adam Tindale - Electronic Drums

The culture around computers and electronics in music has long touted the idea that they could pro- duce any sound that you could imagine. However, to produce these sounds requires a deep knowledge of many different disciplines: from computer programming to hardware design to acoustics and beyond. This has lead to an incredible explosion of one off instruments specifically for one player, most often the inventor.

It was once interesting to create a new musical interface. The novelty has worn off, the audience is primarily concerned with music again. The new age of electronics in computers has come to the end of the beginning of its life. It is no longer emerging, it is here, and we demand that it be measured by musical standards, not as electronic music.
