- ellipse()
- line()
- triangle()
- color()
- fill()
- stroke()
- noStroke()
- noFill() 
- background()
- save()

The first thing we need to do is get acquainted with the language of computers. Often this is referred to as syntax. We need to figure out how to talk to computers. You know how to walk, right? 

## Assignment 1

Play [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html). 

Not so simple. You have to figure out how to issue commands in the way the receiver needs them. This is computer programming. It is a little different, however artists are uniquely equipped to deal with intermediate and complex programming tasks, we just have to learn to walk first. 

## First "Steps"

[Getting Started with Processing](http://processing.org/learning/gettingstarted/)
[Learning Processing Overview](http://processing.org/learning/overview/)

Processing starts out with a blank page. This is not your canvas. The blank canvas for you to fill is the final display window. Your job is to put commands in the programming window that tell Processing how it should fill the display window. 

## Assignment 2

[Coordinate System and Shapes](http://processing.org/learning/drawing/)

*Make a picture using primitive commands only.*

## Assignment 3

*Add colour to your picture.*

Processing has two basic ideas: fill and stroke. Fill is the fill colour for your shape (if it has an interior area) and stroke, which is the outline colour of the shape. You can remove the fill or stroke from your shape by using [noStroke]() or [noFill]().


# Make it Right

- class
- methods
- functions
- comments
- setup()
- draw()
- int
- float
- width
- height
- rectMode()
- ellipseMode()
- random()
- frameRate()
- mouseX
- mouseY
- mousePressed


## A good habit

Commenting. Do it. Leave yourself notes. Breadcrumbs. It's easy. Do it. Future you will appreciate it.

<pre>
/* multi 
        line
            comment*/
// single line comment. 
background(123);// I chose this colour to match my shirt
</pre>

## Animating

Processing makes creating animations very simple. What we need to do is set up our environment and then for every frame of our animation we need to do something. Processing provides us two functions to fill in that it will call when running our sketch: setup() and draw(). Guess which does which? 

These functions need the keyword *void* in front of them. This is a byproduct of Java. It isn't necessary to understand this yet but you do need to make sure it is included. 

In this example we use the [random()](http://processing.org/reference/random_.html) function to give us a random number to place the rect() and to give it a size. 

<pre>
void setup()
{
    // do your setup here
    size( 720, 480);
}

void draw()
{
    // do your drawing here
    rect( random(width), random(height), random(300), random(400) );
}
</pre>


## Assignment 4

*Make a simple animation and use the frameRate() function to change the framerate.*

## Interaction

Processing makes it very easy to interact with the mouse and keyboard. The *mousePressed* keyword will let us know if the mouse is being pressed during the current frame. 

In this example we will draw a rectangle in the middle of sketch if the mouse is being pressed.

<pre> 
if (mousePressed)
    rect(width/2,height/2,100,100);
</pre> 

The *mouseX* and *mouseY* keywords return the x and y position of the mouse during the current frame. We can make a sketch which follows the mouse quite easily.

<pre>
rectMode(CENTER); // otherwise the mouse will be in the top corner of the rect
rect(mouseX,mouseY,100,100);
</pre>

## Assignment 5

*Move your drawing with the mouse.*

## Object Orient Programming

[Down with OOP](http://processing.org/learning/objects/)

Object oriented programming is a cornerstone of modern programming. What we do is abstract our code so that is a general solution to our problem. This allows us to reuse it over and over again. This also helps separate solution from the implementation. We can write an object that knows how to do something and then write a sketch that uses that object to do that thing. 

We do this using the *class* keyword. We write a class to contain our code and it will store some properties and give us methods to access those. Properties are internal variables that we shouldn't touch. 

<pre>

class mything
{
    int xposition;
    int yposition;
    int mysize;
    mything(float x, float y, float s)
    {
       xposition = x; 
       yposition = y;
       mysize = s;
    }
    public void draw()
    {
        rect(xposition, yposition, mysize, mysize);
    }
}


mything thing = new mything(width/2, height/2, 100);
thing.draw();
</pre>


## Assignment 6

*Put your drawing into an class.*

## Self Study

- translate()
- rotate()
- pushMatrix()
- popMatrix()

# Make it Fast

- OPENGL
- PGraphics
- PImage
- MovieMaker


## Rendering Modes + OPENGL

OPENGL is short for the Open Graphics Language. It is a shared format for talking to graphics cards in their native format: polygons. If your sketch uses mostly shapes you will likely benefit from using OPENGL to render your sketch. This will make it much faster and tax your machine less. 

First we will need to import the OPENGL library into our sketch and then we will need to tell Processing to use it instead of the default renderer. Processing has made the second part very simple with the size() function. All we have to do is add one more argument that is the name of the renderer we'd like to use. 

<pre>
import processing.opengl.*;
size( 100,100, OPENGL);
</pre>

## Offscreen Rendering

[Jer Thorp Tutorial](http://blog.blprnt.com/blog/blprnt/processing-tip-rendering-large-amounts-of-text-fast)

When you call a drawing command Processing renders it to the screen then carries on. This can take some time for each command. If you have thousands, or tens of thousands, of things being drawn to the screen the framerate can slow down. What we can do is render the whole scene in memory and the output the resulting scene to the screen. We can do this by using a PGraphics object. It requires a little extra typing but we gain a lot of speed. 

<pre>
Pgraphics offscreen = createGraphics(width,height); // like loadImage. We'll see that later.
offscreen.beginDraw();
offscreen.background(100); // grey backgroun
// do some more drawing in here
offscreen.endDraw();
</pre>

## Output to a video

We can collect frames of our drawing into a video. This can be very useful when your sketch can't run at full framerate and doesn't require any interaction. You can record the output and then show that. 

The following sketch records the first 60 frames and then closes the resulting video file. The file must be closed or your computer will not know where the file ends and your music collection begins (ie. possibility of disaster)

<pre>
import processing.video.*;
MovieMaker mm;  // Declare MovieMaker object

void setup() 
{
  // Do your setup

  // Create MovieMaker object with size, filename,
  // compression codec and quality, framerate
  mm = new MovieMaker(this, width, height, "drawing.mov");
}

void draw() 
{
  // Do your drawing
  if ( frameCount < 60 )
  {
      mm.addFrame();  // Add window's pixels to movie
                  // This is best to do at the end of the draw() function
  } 
  else
  {
    if ( frameCount == 60) 
      mm.finish();  // Finish the movie at frame 60 
                    // We don't want to finish it multiple times
  }
}
</pre>

## Assignment 7

*Output a video file of one of your sketches.*

# Make it Fun

- filter()
- for
- if 
- data folder

## Filters

Ghosting example. 

<pre>
void setup()
{
    /// other setup
    background(0); // put this here to avoid a flash on the first frame
}

void draw()
{
    noStroke();
    fill(0, 5);
    rect(0,0,width,height); // assumes rectMode(CORNER) which is default    
    // do your drawing here
}
</pre>

In the following example we can apply filters to our whole sketch or we can apply them to offscreen buffers stored in PImages.

<pre>
PImage myimage = loadImage("test.jpg");
// some drawing
rect(width/2, height/2, 100,100);
filter(BLUR, 4); // blurs all drawing to this point
myimage.filter(BLUR,4); // blurs our image
image(myimage, width/2, height/2); // puts our blurred image onscreen
</pre>


## Make lots of them

[Arrays](http://processing.org/reference/Array.html)

[Two-Dimensional Arrays](http://processing.org/learning/2darray/)

*for* loops are staples of programming. We can harness the computer's ability to do many things without complaining (unlike humans). In our structure we have to define a variable to keep track of how many times we do something, we give a condition to end our loop, and then we define how we step through it.

In this example we have our variable *i*, which is very common, that will start at zero and then increment to the width of our sketch. We can access our variable inside of our loop to do a different task for each step of the loop.

<pre> 
for( int i = 0; i < width; i = i + 1)
    rect(i,i, 10, 10);
</pre>

The final statement in the for definition is often changed to *i++* which means that the variable *i* is to be incremented by one after it is read. This will increment *i* until such a time that it gets be bigger than *width* and then the loop will end. So, if our sketch is 720 pixels wide then we will draw 720 rectangles diagonally along our canvas.

<pre> 
for( int i = 0; i < width; i++ )
    rect(i,i, 10, 10);
</pre>


## Keeping Track of Lots of Them

You want to have a thousand things. You could make a thousand variables. It would work but it would not be fun. 

Arrays are the solution. These give you one variable name that references multiples. To use these with objects we have to do a little bit of work. Let's use our *mything* object. 

<pre>
mything[] things = new mything[100]; // asks for 100 mything objects

void setup()
{
    size(720,480);
    for ( int i = 0 ; i < things.length; i++)
        things[i] = new mything( (int)random(width), (int)random(height), (int)random(150) ); 
        // cast the random floats to ints
}

void draw()
{
  background(0);
  for ( int i = 0 ; i < things.length; i++)
      things[i].draw();
}

</pre>

## What if?

So want something to happen only if something else is a certain way. You need an *if* statement. *if* will evaluate a statement and run a block of code if it evaluates true. 

<pre> 
if (18 > 5) 
{
    println("True!");
}
</pre>

What if we want to run a different block of code if the evaluation is false? We us an *else* statement for this. In the following example the first block of code will run if the mouse is more than halfway across the screen. 

<pre>
if (mouseX > width/2)
{
    rect(0,0, 100,100);
}
else
{
    ellipse(0,0,100,100);
}
</pre>


## Loading images

Processing makes this very simple. First we have to locate our sktech folder on our hard drive. This is done by pressing apple or command K. You can also access this under the Sketch menu in Processing. Now we need to create a data folder. Anything you put in there will be found by your sketch. 

Let's imagine that we have an image there called "test.jpg" and we want to load it into our sketch and held by a PImage object. 

<pre>
PImage myimage = loadImage("test.jpg");
</pre>

That's it. Seriously. Thanks Processing Dudes!

*Detail* Normally when load classes we have to use the new keyword. In this case loadImage is a special function that looks for files, loads them, and then returns a new PImage object. The function deals with creating our new object inside of itself.
