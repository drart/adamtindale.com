Today I played a bit more with the peakiness function but I went back a
simple particle system that will evolve over longer periods of time. I
borrowed some of the code from yesterday and tried to make it a bit more
gradual and I got some interesting results.

I also spent some time today digging into the Java API and found some
nice features of Arrays. Sorting is actually quite a nice algorithm and
also fill is a great way to just fill up an array with a value. Hooray
for not having to write simple things over and over!
