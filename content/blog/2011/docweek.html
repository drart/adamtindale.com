Hi Everyone, 

Though I have been quiet I have been busy. I really like doing sprint work, like Creative Pact 2010 in September, so I have decided to make my own theme: Documentation. This week I am going to write a new post every day with documentation of what I have been doing in the past few months. I have been playing with software and hardware and doing some shows. You will get a little taste of that in different forms every day this week. I hope you find something that you like!
