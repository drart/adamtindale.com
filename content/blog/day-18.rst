Today I messed around with some simple spectral displays and trying
other parts of the Processing API. I have added curveVertex to my bag of
tricks. This patch has two curvy lissajous spectral displays rotating in
contrary motion and a set of bars representing linear spectral averages.

This was the first time I put some more interaction into a sketch. I
have a key that changes the mode of the layering. I have been working on
things and discovering stuff that I like about a sketch but often it
goes away when I make the final thing that I like most. So, I made a
little mistake in the process and kept it as an option by pressing the d
key.

I still have to look into waterfall plots and buffering. Maybe tomorrow.
