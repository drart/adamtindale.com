`BoxySean`_ sent me a link to `SuperDraw`_ yesterday and I was really
blown away. Then I looked at who was responsible and it made a lot of
sense. So today I thought I would try and do some 3D drawing using sound
levels. I originally tried to make some shapes and have them connect and
then I realized I would have to come up with a smart system for stacking
shapes. That might be another day. For now I have a little reactive
audio drawing tool that I can expand on in the future.
