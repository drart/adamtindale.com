I was again playing with GLGraphics and had a happy accident. I added
some more shaders to a sketch and got these swirling worlds. I think
this is something I am going to keep. I did something I thought I
understood and came up with these great visuals for some reason. This
illustrates to me that I need a little more theory before I dig deeper
with shaders. Some other time.

My big problem is that I haven't added audio so I am diverting a bit
from my original idea at the beginning of the month. Â Tomorrow I will
refocus.
