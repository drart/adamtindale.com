I enrolled for the O'Reilly class on Processing and Arduino and it
starts in 30 minutes. I am hoping that it becomes useful. I do like
controlP5 as a library for guis.

In the meantime I did a few utils. I have an easy save mechanism thanks
to saveFrame() in Processing. I also have some sketch code for recording
video. Surely this will change over the month but these are things that
I thought would be important to start.

I think I may also start a template sketch so I can get straight to my
idea. I'll be sure to put it up if I get to it.

.. raw:: html -- terrible hack for now

    <script src="/theme/js/prism.js"></script>

    <script>
    let codes = document.getElementsByTagName("pre");
    for( let i = 0; i < codes.length; i++){
        codes[i].innerHTML = Prism.highlight(codes[i].innerText, Prism.languages.processing);
    }
    </script>
