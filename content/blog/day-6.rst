Last night I finished watching the first season of `The Wire`_. I have
been watching it on DVD and the splash screen and the opening scene of
the show has all of these signal displays. So, I dusted off my
trigonometry skills and started making some sine waves dance on my
screen.

I have some ideas about how to tweak this a bit more by casting the
shapes to PImages and then applying filters but I have a busy day, so
that will happen another time. I expect that the sketches during the
week will be shorter than the weekend ones. I think that is just how it
goes.
