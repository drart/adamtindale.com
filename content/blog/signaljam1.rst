A night of experimentation put on by Kyle Duffield. The idea is that we come, hack, create from scratch, and jam with our hastily built ideas. A little bit of good music occured but mostly it was a stimulating event that forced everyone to make something quickly and get out, rather than perpetually work on things that never leave the studio. I like this kind of thing. Here are some links to the event, and the thing I made. If you like this kind of thing be sure to check in with interaccess for the next one.
