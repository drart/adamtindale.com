I was hoping to have some success with ArrayLists today but I didn't. I
finally have the waterfall code down but it goes backwards from past to
present instead of present to past. It looks kinda neat this way,
though. I also added colour! For me, Â working in HSB seems to be more
closely related to my headspace than RGB, so if I need colour I am going
to stick to that for now.

This sketch uses linear averages of FFT which are really easy to compute
and set up but the result is less than pleasing. I think tomorrow I will
play with the log function and see if I can get something a little
closer to what I think it should look like.
