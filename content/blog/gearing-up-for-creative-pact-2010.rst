Finally I am going to be staying at home for some length of time. I have
a few goals for the next few months to forward my practice. I need to
improve my `Processing.org`_ skills and learn some new tricks to get my
next project done. To that end I am committing to the Creative Pact 2010
in order to keep myself motivated.

Every day in September I will put up a new post about something creative
I have done in Processing. I was thinking that every post would be audio
+ visuals but I think I am going to keep it manageable. I don't know if
I will have more than an hour a day to be creative since school starts
soon. Weekends will likely have bigger projects, as I will have more
time on those days.

I am hoping to learn some more about Minim, controlP5, GLGraphics and
OpenGL in general as I create this stuff.

For all you Processing experts watching please comment and show me how
to improve my code, coding, and inspiration for visuals. Even links to
things would be super helpful.

I am going to build a few tools for the next few days so I can take some
screenshots and videos easily to post for y'all. I will put them here in
case they are useful for you too.
