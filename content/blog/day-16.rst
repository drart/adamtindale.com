Today I almost forgot to do my piece. I have been watching a lot of Alva
Noto so today is my stab at a classic bass drum gesture. A black screen
with a mouse click that fires a bass drum sample and flashes a white
screen that fades. I didn't think an image of a white or black screen
was worth a screenshot, so enjoy the code.
