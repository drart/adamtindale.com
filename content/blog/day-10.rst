I went out tonight to three art openings around town and I was totally
jazzed from seeing art. So I have come home and tried to do something
before I go to sleep. This is my first sketch that is a continuation of
the day before.

I was looking at things and thinking about in-between. I have made a
simple patch that takes yesterday's patch but adds a cloud of random
points and I can do linear interpolation between the two. It is crude
right now but there are some very interesting intermediate states
between objects that arrive. I have also properly implemented the Dan
Shiffman sugar from his space junk sketch so I get some more variation
from frame to frame.

Again, OPENGL so code will follow the image, now animated.
