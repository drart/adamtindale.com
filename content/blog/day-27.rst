Another day, another experiment. I tried to resurrect my Spectral
Flatness code and I think it is a precision error in the geometric mean.
I thought about scaling the FFT values but I will have to go back on the
math for that to make sure I don't skew the values the wrong way. For
now I have used the arithmetic mean of the spectrum to give me some
numbers to play with.

This sketch changes colour at different volumes, currently white for
quiet and black for loud, and becomes more animated with noisier spectra
(not really but close enough for now). I think I am getting close to
something interesting. Maybe once I sleep on it tomorrow will show me
the answer.
