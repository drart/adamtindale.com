Today was a bit of a bust. I tried writing some GLSL shaders using
`GLGraphics`_ and didn't have much luck. I have been wanting to dig into
the library for awhile but haven't had time, so today was the day. I was
able to get some simple frag shaders going but blurs weren't working. I
upgraded to the new version only to find new functionality came with a
new API. The patch I made works but crashes after 10 seconds or so. When
I have more time I will look further into the issue or post it on the
forums but for now I just have a day to make something.
