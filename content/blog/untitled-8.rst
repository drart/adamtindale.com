Untitled 8 is the first interface implemented using `JunctionBox`_ by a
programmer other than the primary author. The audio engine consists of a
single frequency modulated oscillator with reverb and granular
synthesis effects processing, all implemented in Pd. The interface is
designed for the realization of a loosely scored composition.
