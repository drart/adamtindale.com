I made a bad VJ patch today. I have a rotating sphere made from a series
of line strips with colour gradients. The patch pulses with size and
colour to volume. Maybe soon I will put that feature extraction from the
other day to use and make something a little more sophisticated.

It is made with OPENGL again so I have included the code below.
