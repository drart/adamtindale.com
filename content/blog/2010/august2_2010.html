I am on a Residency with Jordan Tate in Banff to work on my visual competency and I am teaching Jordan about programming and digital media.

Jordan’s first assignment is to make 10 animated gifs in response to other work. Here is part one. This is called 4’33″. I recently saw Rauschenberg’s “White Paintings” at SFMOMA and I was really taken. I love minimalism. I found out through some reading that Cage didn’t really go for the full 4’33″ until he saw these. I like black so I made a black animated gif with various degrees of black. I did this because Cage discovered that you can’t ever experience silence, there is always some noise and jitter.
