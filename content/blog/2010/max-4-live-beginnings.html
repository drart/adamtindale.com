I have been digging into the Max 4 Live API. Interesting stuff in there. I have been using Max/MSP since 2000 and I am pretty familiar with it but this new API opens a whole new set of doors. No longer do I have to deal with buffers or presets, LIVE does all of that for me now.My first experiment that I am sharing is a simple patch that figures out which track it is inserted into, links to that track's volume, pan and send levels and links that to a GUI control in the patch. It is a good starting point if you are new and it helped me clarify a lot of things by going through the exercise. Enjoy.
