In preparing for mono.mono//stereo I searched for something that would
make images that I wanted. I started with Processing but once I started
adding some effects it got way too slow so I found Quartz Composer. I
ended up using that for the piece. That introduced a lot of
communication problems. OSC is not implemented well and there are a lot
of resets and bogus reports. The same data sent to any other program
looks just fine. I am looking to leave Quartz and move to another
language. What I can't find is a good language for drawing in 3D with a
list of arbitrary coordinates.

So, I have been thinking about going back to Processing or checking out
Field. Field has a lot of nice bridges to Max/MSP and some incredible
hybrid code/gui functions. It also binds with python nicely so I could
integrate marsyas and some other systems pretty easily. Could this be
the glue I am looking for?

I am still searching. I have some time coming up and I think I will play
with it a bit and report back.
