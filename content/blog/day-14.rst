Today was a good day. I have settled on 720x480 resolution for now so I
can do things in native DVD resolution and hopefully make some nice
looking video at the end of this experiment. I came up with an idea of
circle that responds to audio. I made it respond to volume for
brightness and I rendered the circle with a crude particle system. I
also added some Alva Noto like flashing for fun.
