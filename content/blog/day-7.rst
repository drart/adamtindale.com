Today's sketch is a take on the mouse controlled ball that you can
rotate and throw. I have a sphere here that is rotated by making a loud
sound. I have done a rather crude thresholding but I discovered that
MINIM has a nice level() call on audiobuffers that return the RMS.
Hooray!

I also discovered that on a mac when you export your patch to the web it
doesn't work well if you are using OPENGL. I have included the code
inline with the blog, which I don't like so much but it will get the
idea to you.

Like I predicted this is a much shorter sketch than on the weekends.
This is going to be the way of it until I get more efficient at my
changing weeks.
