No sound today. I was thinking of making something that might look like
a `Shepard's Tone`_ and I came up with this simple idea of a complex
polygon that expands outwards into the viewer. I got it going and then I
thought it would be cool for it to be endless. I will have to think how
I can do that practically. I have a feeling it will borrow some
waterfall code and test to see if vertices are out of visual range and
then put them back into the pile. I think I will need to sleep on that
one.
