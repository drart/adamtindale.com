Today I had an idea to see if I could kaleidoscope an image or make a
mirror. This was something I was thinking of as a way to illustrate mono
signals and then I could modify the images as the signals diverged. I
played around with rotating a bit and then remembered that it could get
ugly and convoluted so I did a bit of googling and the Processing forums
showed a gem: scale(). I can set the scale to negative values in either
the x or y dimension (or z if you want to get crazy) and then move the
image accordingly and all is fine.

I set up minim to blend a noise image into my scene if there is an onset
and then I played around with rotating boxes again. Look, it isn't black
and white!
