Today's sketch is a play on the random shape clusters that I seem to be
gravitating towards. I used the spectral feature extraction from Day 5
so not all of the code is posted below. You can go to that post and rip
the features if you like.

This sketch uses a more coherent model instead of randomness. There are
20 3D boxes in the sketch that have their colour and placement changed
based upon the sound coming into the sketch. It is reactive but a little
too literal. I think I will try to make some mappings in the future that
can take spectral centroids and do something meaningful visually. Sounds
like a research project!
