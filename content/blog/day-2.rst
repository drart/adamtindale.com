I have been messing with Minim. This is a simple synthesis sketch that
uses a few triangle waves represented by coloured circles and modifies
colour by monitoring the pan (which is randomized a bit).

The really fun features seem to be in the BETA so I will play with that
a bit tomorrow. I am anxious to try out the granulator and the
bitcrusher.
