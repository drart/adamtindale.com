This one has been in the works for awhile. I have been looking at the
minim BETA for a few days and now I feel like I am getting my head
around it. Today I made my first UGen. I think I am going to submit it
to the distribution. It is a byte swapping algorithm inspired by swap~
in zexy for PD. This is one of my favourite distortions. Very loud and
very nasty. You've been warned.

Today I also finally delved into Processing's method for exporting
applets. So, I am not going to dump a whole lot of code in this post. If
you want to see the code follow the links below.

The audio display is rendered as points. This is inspired by something I
saw at MUTEK this year and is also the flavour of the visual material
for Frank Bretschneider's EXP.
