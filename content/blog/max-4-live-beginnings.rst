I have been digging into the Max 4 Live API. Interesting stuff in there.
I have been using Max/MSP since 2000 and I am pretty familiar with it
but this new API opens a whole new set of doors. No longer do I have to
deal with buffers or presets, LIVE does all of that for me now.

My first experiment that I am sharing is a simple patch that figures out
which track it is inserted into, links to that track's volume, pan and
send levels and links that to a GUI control in the patch. It is a good
starting point if you are new and it helped me clarify a lot of things
by going through the exercise. Enjoy.
