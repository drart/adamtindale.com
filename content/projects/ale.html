-----------

The core of an ALE performance is structured improvisation. Like jazz musicians, the members work together closely monitoring each others' sounds and responding in real time. One moment the overall sound is infused with abstract dance beats, and next with deep organic drones and robot bird songs. Rules are made on the fly and often broken once established. Depending on the audience, the architecture, and the collaborators, a 45-minute set might resemble space debris burning across the night sky, or a 90s rave party in ultra slow motion. Every performance is distinct and in many ways unrecognizable from the last.

The group consists of two faculty members, Rick Silva and Adam Tindale, and two students, Bryn Thorhaug and Jennifer Vallis. ALE is both an experimental music ensemble exploring digital sound creation and a rare opportunity for emerging sound artists at ACAD to perform alongside established artists in the field.
