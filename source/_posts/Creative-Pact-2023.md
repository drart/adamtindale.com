This year I will be doing another Creative Pact where I will be learning [gen~](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/refpages/gen~) by making something every day for the month of June 2023. It looks like Creative Pact is largely a thing of the past, and I am not doing this in January to participate in [Genuary](https://genuary.art), but hoepfully there will be something interesting for other folks too. 

There is a great deal of documentation and tutorials available across the internet and I will do my typical scattered approach to learning and exploring, but trying to stay grounded in Graham Wakefield & Gregory Taylor's book [Generating Sound and Organizing Time](https://cycling74.com/books/go). I have been reading it and it has removed the block I had with using gen at all. 

I expect to also dive into [oopsy](https://github.com/electro-smith/oopsy) and try to get some of the more fun patches onto a [bluemchen](https://kxmx-bluemchen.recursinging.com) and do some noise making in the modular world.
