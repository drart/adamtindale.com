Davies and Tindale create ambient electronic textures via laptops,
software and MIDI controllers. Loose compositional structures are built
to be explored via improvisation. A type of stylistic coherency is
achieved by weaving spoken-word recordings through these forms. Texts
are set to music and sound in the manner of a radio-play, but are also
manipulated using modern electroacoustic techniques, drawing on the
traditions of Paul Lansky and Steve Reich.

A common complaint about laptop music collaborations is that the
audience is unable to identify the source of a given sound. Tindale uses
percussion controllers to trigger sounds and processes. This visceral
connection with the sonic effect allows listeners to latch onto the
performance and then deduce which elements are created by Davies. Davies
is exclusively a laptop performer; he builds custom software
environments, using Max/MSP to generate his auditory contributions. The
duo prefer venues where there is no audience-stage barrier, allowing
patrons to peer over performers' shoulders to view the technology at
work.
