# Smackon 9000 {#smackon-9000-1}

This is an early digital musical instrument that was created in a class
at McGill University. The class was divided up into groups containing a
technologist, a performer and a composer. The group was responsible for
designing and implementing a new musical instrument and then creating a
piece of music for it and then having it performed in a concert setting.

The smackon9000 utilized a wacom tablet and a keyboard in order to put
early versions of the instrument into the performer\'s hands. This
allowed the performer to give feedback about the handling of the
instrument and not just speculating on the desired features. The
keyboard emmulates flute fingerings because the performer was a trained
flutist.
