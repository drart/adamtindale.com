# E-Drumset

![image](/img/AdamTindaleSonicBoom.jpg)

The E-Drumset is a new instrument. Many new interfaces are derived to
help lesser players achieve virtuosic ends, while other projects make a
controller that is massively configurable where a more static instrument
is appropriate. This project provides insight into the theory and
practice of new musical interfaces while delivering novel forms of
synthesis and gesture recognition appropriate for the next generation of
Electronic Drumset.

The E-Drumset is collection of software and hardware that allows
alternatives to the acoustic components of the drumset. By mixing the
components into different combinations it can be personalized for each
player. The hardware can be any sound source that sends a signal into a
computer so that it may be processed by the software.

# Demo: Timbre-Recognition Based Instruments

A new paradigm in gesture recognition systems that utilizes music
information retrieval approaches. Timbre-recognition based instruments
use real time classification techniques to determine the gesture used in
order to provide high level information to the player.
