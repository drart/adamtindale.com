# Trimpin\'s Turntables {#trimpins-turntables-1}

Trimpin, the famous sound sculptor, brought his musical turntable robots
to the University of Victoria and left them for two months to allow
students to deeply explore them. During this time I currated the exhibit
locally and provided initial training to all particpants, as well as
giving demos for interested researchers.

My short performance utilizes a game controller and Max/MSP to send MIDI
messages to the robots. Various Wagner records were used as source
material.
